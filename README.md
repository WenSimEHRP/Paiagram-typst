# Paiagram

Paiagram is a typst package for making transportation timetable diagrams, or a train running chart, or whatever you call it.

## Using Paiagram

To start, you must already have the following items:

- **Train** (or any other means of transport) timetable information.
- **Station** information.
- (Optional, recommended) station **interval** information.
- A set of stations to draw on the diagram. This is not the same as station information.

For more information, please check examples in the `examples` folder.

## Importing from other files

Paiagram currently supports importing data from qETRC files. Support for other formats (oudiasecond, ETRC, etc.) are planned.
